### Add-on for Ferrisgram

This represents a small and personalized add-on for Ferrisgram to ease my new projects based on it.
It adds some default commands and callback stuff automatically, etc.
It has a boilerplate in [wildfire-cli](/wildfire-cli) which further simplifies the work for me.

**Note**: Not meant for public use.
